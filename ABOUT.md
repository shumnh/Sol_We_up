## Project Name
**Solana Uptime Validator**

## Description
Solana Uptime Validator is a simple and modern web application that helps users monitor the uptime and performance of their websites. The system uses a network of validators to check websites from different locations and records the results. It leverages the Solana blockchain for secure validator authentication and potential reward distribution.

### What Users Can Do
- Register and manage websites to monitor.
- View real-time and historical uptime data.
- Benefit from decentralized and transparent validation.

### What Validators Can Do
- Sign up using their Solana wallet.
- Participate in website checks and earn rewards.

## Key Features
- **Website Monitoring:** Track uptime and latency for any website.
- **Decentralized Validators:** Multiple independent validators check websites for better reliability.
- **Solana Integration:** Uses Solana blockchain for secure identity and possible payouts.
- **User Dashboard:** Simple, modern interface to view website status and history.
- **Secure Authentication:** Uses Clerk for user login and JWT for API security.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React** – User interface library
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Clerk** – User authentication and management
- **Radix UI** – Accessible UI components
- **Lucide React** – Icon library
- **Axios** – HTTP client for API requests

### Backend
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for the server
- **Express** – Web framework for building APIs
- **CORS** – Middleware for cross-origin requests
- **JWT** – Secure authentication tokens
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing users, websites, validators, and checks

### Web3 / Blockchain
- **Solana** – Blockchain platform for validator identity and rewards
- **@solana/web3.js** – Solana JavaScript SDK for blockchain interactions
- **@solana/kit** – Solana wallet integration
- **tweetnacl** – Cryptographic functions for signing and verifying messages

## How It Works (In Simple Words)
1. **Users** sign up and add their websites to be monitored.
2. **Validators** (people or servers) sign up with their Solana wallet and check the status of these websites.
3. The system records each check (uptime, latency, etc.) and stores the results.
4. Users can see the status of their websites on a dashboard.
5. Validators may receive rewards for their work, managed through the Solana blockchain.
